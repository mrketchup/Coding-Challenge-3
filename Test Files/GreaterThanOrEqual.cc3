# Input:
# Register 0 contains the first number
# Register 1 contains the second number
#
# Output:
# Register 9 will contain 1 if the first number >= second number, 0 if not
#

# Setup our goto registers

set 2 3 #0 #Point to line of code for looping
set 3 8 #Point register to check second number line
set 4 9 #Pointer to adjust to true or false path


# Add 1 to each number until one of them becomes 0

add 0 1
add 1 1


# Make checks for 0

goto 3 0 #5 #Jump to check second number
add  4 2 #Move pointer to true path
goto 4 4 #The first number is greater than or equal!

goto 2 1
add  4 4 #Move pointer to false path
goto 4 4 #10 #The second number is greater!


# Set register 9 to 1 (true) and exit

set 9 1
exit


# Set register 9 to 0 (false) and exit

set 9 0
exit
